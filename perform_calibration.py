"""
This script takes a calibration dataset captured with the script `capture_calib_dataset.py` and performs camera and hand-eye calibration.

This script takes in a calibration directory and adds the following files to it:
    - sparse/0/images_checkerboard.txt : Contains the poses of the checkerboard pattern with respect to the camera coordinate system --> T_world2cam
    - sparse/0/cameras.txt : Contains the camera intrinsics
    - sparse/0/hand_eye_pose.txt : Contains the Hand-Eye-Pose (pose of the tool with respect to the cam) --> T_tool2cam
    - sparse/0/images.txt : Contains the MoCap poses corrected by the Hand-Eye-Transform (poses of the MoCap base with respect to the CCS) --> T_base2cam

The path to this calibration directory can then be passed as an argument to the StreamMatcher class, which is then able to correct the MoCap poses by the Hand-Eye-Pose and the camera intrinsics.

Flags:
    --calib_path : Path to the previously captured calibration dataset. 
                    Either pass a custom path or 'latest' for the latest timestamped calibration dataset in './data/calibrations'.
